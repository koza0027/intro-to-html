        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hello, I'm currently studying graphic design at Algonquin College and enjoying this program. I get to solve creative problems in unique and challenging ways, which I find quite rewarding. After this program, I plan on continuing my studies and doing a BDes program, or jumping straight into the world of work.</p>

        <p>Outside of college, I enjoy a variety of hobbies such as content creation for a medium-sized Instagram following, digital design creation as a passion project (album covers, packaging, merch etc.), and occasional music making. This variety of creative hobbies helps me be an occupied, happy and productive individual.</p>

        <p>When I want to unwind completely, I occasionally watch some mindless TV and YouTube and listen to trap and hyperpop music on Spotify. Despite not being a naturally sociable person, I try to socialize after college classes once a week, and I try to befriend people who have similar goals and life experiences to me.</p>

        <p> Here's a motivational quote in the words of one of Apple Inc. founders:</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>“You have to be burning with an idea, or a problem, or a wrong that you want to right. If you’re not passionate enough from the start, you’ll never stick it out.”</p>
          <cite>-Steve Jobs</cite>
        </blockquote>
